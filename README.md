This repository demonstrates how to interface a **16x2 alphanumeric LCD** with the **8051 Microcontroller** using **Assembly language**. The project is designed to showcase a practical example of sending data from the **8051 microcontroller** to an LCD and includes **Proteus simulation files** for testing and visualization.

The project involves setting up the **LCD in 4-bit mode** to reduce pin usage, making it suitable for embedded systems where limited I/O pins are available. The data is transferred in two 4-bit nibbles, simplifying the circuit while maintaining full functionality.

Using a **1602 LCD** with microcontrollers like the **8051** (or any other MCU) and simulating the circuit in **Proteus** requires several steps. The **1602 LCD** is a common 16x2 character display used in embedded systems for displaying information.

> **Note**: The resistor network **RN1** in the Proteus schematic is needed only in the simulator (for **PORT 0**), but not in real hardware, where it has been successfully tested without external resistor pull-ups.

# ‚öôÔ∏è **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the **interfacing of an LCD** with the **[AT89C51](https://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/8051.aspx)** microcontroller, part of the **[8051 MCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MCS-51)** family. It allows for displaying data on the LCD, making it a practical example for educational purposes and embedded systems applications.

In this project, we cover:

- Configuring the **LCD in 4-bit mode** to save microcontroller pins.
- Sending commands such as clearing the display, setting the cursor position, and controlling the display (on/off, blinking).
- Displaying **alphanumeric characters** on the LCD, including custom messages.
- Implementing **timing and delays** to ensure reliable communication between the microcontroller and the LCD.
