      A Liquid Crystal Display commonly abbreviated as LCD is basically 
      a display unit built using Liquid Crystal technology. 
      It is an inevitable part in almost all embedded projects and this 
      article is about interfacing a 16×2 LCD with 8051 microcontroller. 
      Many guys find it hard to interface LCD module with the 8051 but 
      the fact is that if you learn it properly, its a very easy job and 
      by knowing it you can easily design embedded projects like digital 
      voltmeter / ammeter, digital clock, home automation displays, 
      status indicator display, digital code locks, digital 
      speedometer/ odometer, display for music players etc etc.<br><br>
  
      Thoroughly going this article will make you able to display any 
      text (including the extended characters) on any part of the 16×2 
      display screen. In order to understand the interfacing first you 
      have to know about the LCD modules.

            A seven segment display consists of seven LEDs arranged in the form 
            of a squarish‘8’ slightly inclined to the right and a single LED as 
            the dot character. Differentcharacters can be displayed by 
            selectively glowing the required LED segments.

            <br><br>The displays common pin is generally used to identify which 
            type of 7-segmentdisplay it is. As each LED has two connecting pins, 
            one called the “Anode” andthe other called the “Cathode”, there are 
            therefore two types of 7-segment displaycalled: Common Cathode7(CC) 
            and Common Anode8(CA).

            A CC SSD circuit activity has shown at left of above figure. We can 
            see that only two switches (b and c) are closed and all other 
            switches are open. So, we can produce the binary data pattern as 
            00000110 which is equivalent to 03H. And we are getting the decimal 
            value 1 is illuminated on the display. And Now we can have all the 
            required data patterns for displaying 0 to 9 using the same method 
            as in the table of above figure.

        <strong>Circuit Discussion :</strong>
        The circuit diagram shown above is of an AT89S51 microcontroller based 0 
        to 9 counter which has a 7 segment LED display interfaced to it in order 
        to display the count.  This simple circuit illustrates two things. How 
        to setup simple 0 to 9 up counter using 8051 and more importantly how 
        to interface a seven segment LED display to  8051 in order to display 
        a particular result. The common cathode seven segment display D1 is 
        connected to the Port 1 of the microcontroller (AT89S51) as shown in the 
        circuit diagram. R3 to R10 are current limiting resistors. S3 is the 
        reset switch and R2,C3 forms a debouncing circuitry. C1, C2 and X1 are 
        related to the clock circuit. The software part of the project has to do 
        the following tasks.

        <h3>Theory Part 2/2 : Multiplexing SSDs</h3>
        <p>
            Suppose you need a three digit display connected to the 8051. Each 7 
            segment display have 8 pins and so a total amount of 24 pins are to 
            the connected to the microcontroller and there will be only 8 pins 
            left with the microcontroller for other input output applications. 
            Also the maximum number of displays that can be connected to the 8051 
            is limited to 4 because 8051 has only 4 ports. More over three 3 
            displays will be ON always and this consumes a considerable amount of 
            power. All these problems associated with the straight forward method 
            can be solved by  multiplexing .
        </p>

        <div class="capt_cont">Fig: Multiple digit Multiplexing tecnique.</div>

        <p>In multiplexing all displays are connected in parallel to one port 
            and only one display is allowed to turn ON at a time, for a short 
            period. This cycle is repeated for at a fast rate and due to the 
            persistence of vision of human eye, all digits seems to glow. The 
            main advantages of this method are

        <p>
            When assembled and powered on, the circuit will display the number
            ’16’ and let us see how it is done. Initially the first display is 
            activated by making  P3.0 high and then digit drive pattern for “1” 
            is loaded to  the Port 1. This will make the first display to show 
            “1”. In the mean time P3.1 will be low and so do the second display 
            will be OFF. This condition is maintained for around 1ms and then 
            P3.0 is made low. Now both displays will be OFF. Then the second 
            display is activated by making P3.1 high and then the digit drive 
            pattern for “6” is loaded to the port 1. This will make the second 
            display to show “6”. In the mean time P3.0 will be low and so the 
            second display will be OFF.  This condition is maintained for 
            another 1ms and then port 3.1 is made low. This cycle is repeated 
            and due to the persistence of vision you will feel it as “16”.

            <br><br>Transistor Q1 drives the first display (D1) and transistor 
            Q2 drives the second display (D2). R11 and R12 are the base current 
            limiting resistors of Q1 and Q2. The purpose of other components 
            are explained in the first circuit.
